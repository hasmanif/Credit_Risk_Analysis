# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to employ techniques to train and evaluate models using resampling. Using a dataset provided from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending service, the data is oversampled using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE alogrithms, and undersampled using a ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, a combinational approach of over- and undersampling is used using SMOTEENN algorithm. The learning models are then compared to predict credit risk and is finally evaluated based on their performance. This project was completed using python and Jupyter Notebook.
